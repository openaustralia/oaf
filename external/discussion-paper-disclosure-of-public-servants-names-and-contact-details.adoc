Summary
~~~~~~~

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is aware of
agency concerns about the disclosure of public servants’ names and
contact details in the context of FOI requests, both in response to FOI
requests and when requests are being processed.

The purpose of this discussion paper is twofold; firstly to provide
greater awareness of the relevant guidance and decisions regarding the
disclosure of public servants’ names and contact details, including the
circumstances in which public servants’ names and contact details may be
released or published in response to an FOI request and when they may be
exempt from disclosure. Secondly, this discussion paper also seeks to
explore agency concerns and practices in relation to this issue.

It is not the intention of this discussion paper to explore the legal
requirements for the name and designation of a decision maker to be
stated in a notice of decision
(ss http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s26.html[26(1)(b)]
and
http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s29.html[29(9)])
or the name and contact details in a request consultation notice
(http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s24ab.html[s 24AB(2)(c)
and (d)]).

Rather, this paper focusses on the circumstances in which public
servants’ names and contact details are included in the documents at
issue, and the FOI Act provisions that agencies have relied on to
withhold this information from disclosure — namely
ss http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s22.html[22]
(relevance),

personnel),
http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s47e.html[47E(d])

In seeking to further explore this issue, we invite you to comment on
your experience as an FOI practitioner, or as someone who has sought
access to information from an Australian Government agency or minister.
To assist you to do this, at the end of this paper we have posed a
series of questions to explore the issues and have provided information
about how you can submit your comments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information gathered as part of this consultation will be used to
consider whether the FOI Guidelines provide sufficient and appropriate
guidance for agencies and ministers in relation to the disclosure of the
names and contact details of public servants in the current information
access landscape.

[[background]]
Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Public servants’ names and contact details may be in a wide range of
documents generated and held by Australian government agencies. Usually
this is because the public servant was involved, to some degree or
extent, with the work which is the subject of the
documents.footnote:[Part 6.157 of the FOI Guidelines distinguishes
between this kind of personal information and personal information that
_does not_ relate to the public servant’s usual duties and
responsibilities. For example, if a document contains information about
an individual’s disposition or private characteristics, such as the
reasons a public servant has applied for personal leave, information
about their performance management or whether they were unsuccessful in
a recruitment process. This kind of personal information is not the
subject of this issues paper.]

It has long been considered that in general, disclosure of public
servants’ names in response to an FOI request would not be unreasonable.
Such disclosure forms part of the system of accountability and
transparency of government actions and decision making.

Freedom of Information Memorandum No. 94 (dated June
1994)footnote:[Freedom of Information Memorandums were issued by the
Attorney-General’s Department and provided guidance to Australian
government agencies in exercising powers and discharging functions under
the FOI Act.] states:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
12 … It was not Parliament's intention to provide anonymity for public
officials each time one of them is mentioned in a file. That would be
contrary to the stated aims of the FOI Act and would not assist in
promoting openness or accountability.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Further, in relation to consultation, Memorandum No. 94 states [emphasis
added]:

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
\21. One major example of circumstances which would be relevant [to the
need to consult under s 27A] is where the name of an official appears in
a document in the normal course of the official's duties. _There is no
personal privacy interest in that information, and there is no need to
consult with officials in such circumstances._ The situation would be
different, however, where the information related to something in which
there may be some real privacy concern, such as work performance
information concerning an individual official, or information relating
to alleged disciplinary offences or sexual harassment. Other information
relating to an official may be entirely private in nature, such as
information relating to the official's entitlement to bereavement leave
because of the death of a close relative…
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The OAIC’s view, as expressed in the FOI Guidelines, is that it would
not be unreasonable to disclose public servants’ personal information
unless special circumstances exist:

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
6.153 Where public servants’ personal information is included in a
document because of their usual duties or responsibilities, it would not
be unreasonable to disclose unless special circumstances existed. This
is because the information would reveal only that the public servant was
performing their public duties. Such information may often also be
publicly available, such as on an agency website.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The FOI Guidelines recognise that in some circumstances disclosure of
public servants’ personal information, including their names, may be
unreasonable:

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
6.154 When considering whether it would be unreasonable to disclose the
names of public servants, there is no basis under the FOI Act for
agencies to start from the position that the classification level of a
departmental officer determines whether his or her name would be
unreasonable to disclose. _In seeking to claim the exemption an agency
needs to identify the special circumstances which exist rather than
start from the assumption that such information is exempt._ [Emphasis
added]

6.155 In _Maurice Blackburn Lawyers and Department of Immigration and
Border Protection_ [2015] AICmr 85, where the agency raised the concern
that disclosure would affect the personal safety of its officers, the
Information Commissioner said that there is no apparent logical basis
for distinguishing between the disclosure of SES officers and other
officers’ names, particularly where the purported concern is that
disclosure could affect personal safety.

6.156 A document may, however be exempt for another reason, for example,
where disclosure would, or could reasonably be expected to, endanger the
life or physical safety of any person (s 37(1)(c)). In addition, where
an individual has a propensity to pursue matters obsessively and there
is no need for them to contact a particular public servant in the
future, disclosure of the public servant’s name may be unreasonable.

[[decisions-commonwealth-and-other-jurisdictions]]
Decisions: Commonwealth and other jurisdictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been various decisions made by the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT) and former and current Information, FOI and Privacy
Commissioners regarding the disclosure of the names and contact details
of public servants. These decisions discuss the relevant legislative
tests and the submissions provided by agencies to demonstrate why such
information should exempt. In cases where agencies have claimed that
names and contact details are conditionally exempt, this requires first,
consideration as to whether the relevant exemption has been made out,
and second, whether disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.

In the context of Information Commissioner (IC) reviews,
http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s55d.html[s 55D]
of the FOI Act provides that the agency or Minister bears the onus of
establishing that an FOI decision is justified or that the Information
Commissioner should give a decision adverse to the IC review applicant.
When making an IC review decision, the Information Commissioner relies
on agencies making submissionsfootnote:[See
https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-guidelines/part-10-review-by-the-information-commissioner#on-receiving-a-review-application[Part
10] of the FOI Guidelines and
‘https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/ic-review-procedure-direction/direction-as-to-certain-procedures-to-be-followed-in-ic-reviews[Direction
as to certain procedures to be followed in IC reviews]’.] and providing
evidence to establish that special circumstances exist (such that it
would be unreasonable to disclose public servants’ personal
information), or that disclosure would have a substantial adverse effect
on the proper and efficient conduct of agency operations or on the
management or assessment of personnel by the Commonwealth or by an
agency, and that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.

The table at *Attachment A* to this paper highlights the approach taken
by the AAT and the Information Commissioners when considering whether it
would be unreasonable to disclose public servants’ personal information.

The table at *Attachment B* summarises decisions from other relevant
jurisdictions regarding the disclosure of public servants’ names.
Although caution is required when considering cases from other
jurisdictions, the principles articulated are consistent with the
approach adopted by the OAIC despite these legislative differences.

[[consultation-questions]]
Consultation Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAIC seeks comment on the issues raised in this paper.

Please provide examples of the situations or circumstances you describe
in your submissions. To assist you frame your response, you may wish to
consider the following questions.

For agencies:

1.  Does your agency have concerns about releasing the names and contact
details of staff in response to FOI requests? If so, what are your
concerns? Has your agency experienced any specific work health and
safety issues as a result of a person’s name or contact details being
released in response to an FOI request?
2.  Have your agency’s views on this issue changed over time? If so,
please describe any factors that have affected your agency’s
approach, including technological, environmental or legal factors.
3.  Does your agency advise staff, including contractors undertaking
functions on behalf of the agency, that names and contact details may be
released in response to an FOI request as part of your agency’s training
and induction programs?
4.  How do you balance work health and safety considerations with the
objects of the FOI Act, which include increasing public participation in
Government processes with a view to promoting better-informed decision
making and increasing scrutiny, discussion, comment and review of the
Government’s activities?
5.  If your agency considers that disclosure of a public servant’s name
or contact details will negatively impact their health or safety, what
evidence do you require before deciding that their name or contact
details are exempt from disclosure?
6.  Do you consider the FOI Guidelines provide enough guidance for
agencies when considering these issues?
7.  In what circumstances do you consider that a public servant’s
personal information (name and contact details) are irrelevant to the
FOI request?
8.  Where you have withheld the names and contact details of public
servants, what impact does deleting this information from documents have
on the time it takes to process FOI requests?

For members of the public:

1.  As a person who has requested access to documents from an Australian
Government agency, have you been denied access to the names of agency
staff? Did you consider this decision was justified? If no, why not?
2.  What are your views on deletion of the names of public servants and
their contact details before documents are released in response to an
FOI request? What are the reasons for your view?

Unreasonable to disclose any personal information of Departmental staff
but not unreasonable to disclose names of staff (but not contact
details) of staff engaged by the Commissioner for Complaints

(Section 41(1))footnote:[Section 41 of the FOI Act is the equivalent
provision to s 47F in the current FOI Act.]

[19]–[27]

 a|
* The relevant personal information relates exclusively to public
servants in the context of their performance of their public duties. As
a general rule, disclosure of such personal information will not be
unreasonable.
* There was evidence before the Tribunal that the applicant had engaged
in intimidating and aggressive behaviour, both by telephone and in
person, against staff of the Department of Health and Ageing and had
made threats against officers. In these circumstances disclosure of any
personal information would be unreasonable.
* However in relation to staff employed by the Commissioner of
Complaints, while there was evidence that the applicant had communicated
aggressively by telephone and in letters on numerous occasions, there
was no evidence of any threatening or intimidating behaviour towards
particular officers. Further, there was no evidence that any officer
specifically objected to their personal information being disclosed to
the applicant. As a result, the Tribunal considered it would not be
unreasonable to disclose the names of officers contained in the relevant
documents, but that it would be unreasonable to disclose contact details
— namely, email addresses, direct work telephone and fax number.

Not unreasonable to disclose names of public servants who attended
meetings as contained in the Attorney-General’s diary

[50]

 a|
* There is no basis upon which the personal privacy exemption can apply
insofar as the names of public servants are disclosed as having attended
meetings with the Attorney-General.

a|
Not unreasonable to disclose messages to which FOI applicant is a party

Disclosing internal investigation reports would have a substantial
adverse impact on the management of personnel

(Sections 47E(c) and 4F)

 a|
* There can be no proper claim under s 47F where the applicant is a
party to the communication; even when documents include derogatory
comments about others, information about performance reviews and
supervision, or personal information unrelated to the individual’s
duties as a public servant (personal email addresses, mobile numbers,
feelings and health issues).
* Candour is essential when an agency investigates complaints,
especially those of bullying and harassment. Staff may be reluctant to
provide information and cooperate with investigators if the subject
matter of those discussions is disclosed and made public.

a|
Not unreasonable to disclose names of people interviewed as part of
criminal investigation

(Section 47F)

(20 May 2016)

[40]–[55]

 a|
* Although in the circumstances of this matter it would not be
unreasonable to disclose the names of people interviewed as part of a
criminal investigation, because this information appears in the
documents because of their usual duties and responsibilities, it will
not the case that it will never be unreasonable to disclose this
information.
* The relevant report was more than 12 years old and related to events
that occurred 17 months before its creation. The level of detriment
following disclosure would be low or no-existent. which mitigated
against finding that disclosure

Contrary to the public interest to disclose email addresses, surnames,
signatures

1044 (20 December 2016)

[37]–[45]

 a|
* Disclosing the surnames, signatures, email addresses and user IDs of
officers, other than particular executive officers would be contrary to
the public interest.
* The potential for harm was a real given the nature of agency’s role
(harassment from complainants and other inappropriate contact).

[53]–[56]

 a|
* The exempt material identifies staff on duty at Australia’s Nuclear
Science and Technology Organisation on a particular day.
* The Respondent submits that the zeal with which the applicant pursued
his application indicates he may press these staff for more information.
* The Tribunal was not satisfied the Respondent had established that the
applicant has a tendency to pursue matters obsessively, or that there is
no need for him to contact the relevant persons in the future. The
factual background to the FOI request was not relevant to the issues for
determination in this review and although the Tribunal accepted the
applicant had pursued his application with unusual vigour, whether this
amounted being obsessive depends on underlying facts not within the
scope of the review. Similarly, whether there was any need for him to
contact relevant staff depends on the same questions, as well as his
intentions as to other litigation, which would be speculative to
consider on the evidence before the Tribunal.
* The fact that the applicant sought to call the named individuals to
give evidence was not relevant to the decision whether the documents
were exempt (see s 11(2) of the FOI Act).

* Agencies should not start from the position that an officer’s

* Whether the applicant intends disseminating the names of departmental

[27]–[29} and [35]–[37]

 a|
* The Tribunal was not satisfied that the nature and extent of previous
contact between the applicant with Agency staff amounted to special
circumstances that would make disclosure of officers’ names and titles
unreasonable (two telephone conversations, two missed calls on a staff
member’s work mobile telephone and one voicemail message requesting a
hard copy of the redacted documents).
* Disclosure of names and titles would not be unreasonable.
* Merely asserting that disclosure would have a substantial adverse
impact on agency operations is not sufficient to discharge an agency’s
onus under s 55 of the FOI Act. Evidence is needed to establish that the
centralised complaints management process would be affected by the
applicant directly contacting staff. This was especially so because the
evidence was that many of the relevant staff no longer worked for the
Agency.

January 2012)

Decision of Assistant Information Commissioner (Queensland)

 a|
* Routine personal work information can be distinguished from other
personal information.
* The potential harm from disclosing routine personal work information
is in most circumstances minimal or non-existent because public service
officers are employed in the business of government to deliver services
to the public. The public is generally entitled to know the identity of
service deliverers, advice givers and decision makers.
* A reasonable public service officer would expect that information
which is solely their routine personal work information will be made
available to the public.

* There is no blanket level at which all junior public servants’ names

* Evidence was provided that in the past correspondence from Home Office
officials had been published on the internet which led to officials
being targeted. The Commissioner accepted that the nature of the
information could lead to individuals being targeted and the distress
this would cause was a factor which made disclosure of the names of
junior home office officials unfair.

opinion under the Official Information Act_]

Opinion of New Zealand Ombudsman Ref: 320402 (14 December 2012)

[4]–[21]

 a|
* The Ombudsman did not accept an argument that ‘less senior’ staff
without decision making responsibility have privacy interests that need
protecting.
* ‘The names of officials should, in principle, be made available when
requested. All such information normally discloses is the fact of an
individual's employment and what they are doing in that role. Anonymity
may be justified if a real likelihood of harm can be identified but it
is normally reserved for special circumstances such as where safety
concerns arise.’
